  <li>You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area. 
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or 
inconvenience an individual or group(s) of players in a way that the 
game does not allow. This includes, but is not limited to:  
    <ul>
      <li> Continually killing players of the same fraction on a safe map.*</li>
      <li>Blocking any doorway of any building. Blocking within a map with the intention of impairing the normal playability of the zone. 
        <ul>
          <li>If there is another way to enter the map and a player(s) is disrupting one entrance, this is not considered blocking.        </li>
          <li>During a Crusade or Siege it's "all out war". Blocking doors, entrances to maps and pathways is a legal tactic.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Boxing a player is legal everywhere, except if it results in blocking of a doorway to a building.</li>
      <li>Bringing summons from the spell "Summon-Creature", Ogre Pots 
or any summon scrolls to the entrances of the Promise Lands and the 
Beginner Dungeon. 
        <ul>
          <li>Area effect spells such as "Cloud-Kill" and "Poison-Cloud" are legal, as is the use of "Fire Bows".</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested 
spawn site or a Game Master's (GM's) event after having been instructed 
to do so by a HelbreathUSA representative.</li>
      <li> Making excessive [spam] and inappropriate use of public channels of communications in general, town, guild, local and whispers.</li>
      <li> Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses, abusing spell effects, etc.).</li>
      <li>Causing intentional experience loss to other players 
(deliberately impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, 
intentionally training NPC's on other players, etc.).<br>
        <em>        If you feel some one is disrupting the normal 
playability of a zone or area, please take screen shots and submit them 
with a TIXX at http://www.helsupport.com.</em><br>
        <em> * Any map where you are sent to jail for killing a member 
of town where the repetitive killing of any person by a singular person 
or guild is considered a "safe map" and could result in further action. 
Maps protected by the jail penalty are designed for leveling, and 
players should be allowed to do so without the domination of another 
player(s) killing them by PK (Same town). This is determined by 
Administration. Any map where you remain on the map for killing a member
 of town is deemed to be part of game mechanics and to be handled within
 the game by players. Maps that are not protected by the jail penalty 
are designed for hunting, and players should be able to do so with the 
knowledge that they are in a dangerous map. This is determined by 
Administration. As long as no 1 person or guild is being hunted down and
 killed specifically because they are that person or targeted because 
they are in that guild. Pit etiquette* is to be expected but not 
required by the person entering the area. As long as 1 group of people 
do not dominate an area full time. This is determined by Administration.
 * Asking if they mind your presence, reacting on their reply as you see
 fit.</em>
      </li>
      <li>You may not abuse the ability to have multiple clients in order to spy on the other town.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You may not defraud other players. Fraud is defined as falsely 
representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense, this 
is determined by Administration. Examples of this activity include, but 
are not limited to, using deception to deprive another player of items, 
slandering another player or impersonating them with the intention of 
causing harm to that player's reputation, or falsely representing one's 
identity in order to gain access to another player's items, account or 
account information also referred to as scamming. </li>

  <li> Sharing items in game is <u>not</u> supported by IENT, doing so 
is at your own risk. If you share your items with some one who shares 
their account unbeknownst to you, it is still your responsibility having
 given the items in the first place. We reserve the right to act on each
 report as necessary and treat each one as required. IENT takes no 
responsibility for lost or stolen items if you share your account. 
Accidentally selling items or passing them to another player is the 
responsibility of the player.  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>IEntertainment offer a "confirmation screenshot" service for 
people who want to share items. You, the lender are required to take a 
screenshot of the person you are lending your item to and have them 
clearly state that they will return the item when you request it. 
Screenshots MUST be kept up-to-date (within a 2 week time period) other 
wise they risk being invalid. You need to have proof that the item is 
being lent and not given. This does not protect you if the item is 
unintentionally lost by the sharer. If the item is lost accidently 
through a mis-click, the item can not be restored. </li>
  </ul>
  <li>We reserve the right to change, disband or delete offensive 
Character and Guild names or profiles without prior notification of the 
account holder.</li>
  <li>Laming is the organizing of the enemy to benefit yourself or your town. This is split in to two different sections.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>EKs are Enemy Kills and are used for getting Hero Gear and event
 items. Laming EKs is when the another character from the opposite 
fraction assists in being killed to facilitate the gaining of the EKs 
which are used to collect Hero Gear. Whether an EK is lamed is 
determined by GM1 through the use of game logs. Laming EKs is punished 
by the removal of all EKs and any Hero Gear previously gained on the 
account, not just the character. Repeat offenders will have a 20% exp 
removal. Kill toys, the characters which are killed in order to get the 
EKs will be locked and possibly deleted regardless of items held on the 
character.</li>
    <li>Crusade Points - During the crusade points are given by killing 
the enemy, random enemy town summons, enemy buildings and enemy units. 
Laming crusade points by organizing a member of the enemy town to create
 buildings with the intention of being killed by yourself or your guild 
or your fellow town people is laming points. Guilds who take advantage 
of the game mechanics by abusing in such a manner will have the Guild 
Master sent to bleeding island to break the connection between the 
summons and the Guild Master. If the abuse continues the Guild Master 
account will be locked for a minimum of a week and the guild will be 
disband.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>"<em>It was a joke</em>.." or "<em>I didn't know</em>" - is not 
viable as an excuse. Saying or doing anything that is normally 
punishable under our rules is still punishable despite the fact that you
 and the other person involved may have thought it all humorous or 
didn't know. No one else is in on the joke so it is taken seriously and 
dealt with in accordance with the other rules listed here.</li>
  <li> Item restoration is possible if iEntertainment is informed within
 24 hours of the item being either sold to the Blacksmith or Shop 
Keeper. Scroll restoration is also possible if iEntertainment is 
informed within 24 hours of the item being depleted / learnt by the 
character - In some cases a restoration scroll may be required from the 
online store.<em> IEntertainment can not restore any items lost due to 
misplacement EG: Dropping on the ground or passed to another person 
(accidentally or intentional). Items lost due to sharing the item and or
 account information is not covered by this rule</em>. </li>
  <li>IEntertainment  offers a slate restoration service to any slates 
lost due to disconnection. IEntertainment must be notified within 24 
hours of the lost slate via TIXX at http://www.helsupport.com.</li>
  <li>You may not abuse your characters civilian stats in order to benefit or harm in a PvP situation. While iEnt understands that <em>spying happens</em>,
 actively taking part in any PvP situation in order to interrupt it 
intentionally will result in punishment. Using your civilian to watch 
the PvP is included, use a traveler instead.</li>
  <li>Harassment to a player or intentionally causing unwanted stress to
 a player beyond what is deemed acceptable to administration, while they
 have a slate activated is not allowed.<br>
    This includes but is not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li><em><strong>Experience Slates</strong></em>- Luring monsters 
out of a pit to cause an experience loss and or disrupting the normal 
playability of the zone with the intention of disrupting or reducing the
 experience gained while on the slate. <em>Being EKed while on an experience slate is a risk that a player takes when using a slate</em>.<br>
      </li>
      <li><em><strong>Mana Slates</strong></em>- Intentionally causing grief to the person who has the slate activated. <em>Being EKed while on a mana slate is a risk that a player takes when using a slate</em>.<br>
      </li>
      <li><em> <strong>Health Slate</strong></em> - Due to the nature of the Health slate giving the player invincibility from damage except when AOE spells are used  <em>and</em> no endurance loss from armor, it is deemed "<em>fair play</em>"
 that the Slater becomes susceptible to some forms of distraction. 
However, if the person using the slate becomes harassed due to using the
 slate, warnings can be issued under the harassment rule and deal with 
accordingly.
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>"<em>Area of Effect</em>" spells that do damage to the 
slate user despite the infinite hit points are not to be excessively 
used on the Slater and are to be limited to a hinderance, determined by 
administration.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> <strong><em>Berserk Slate</em></strong> - Attempting to cause the character to disconnect or otherwise cancel the effect of the slate. <em>Being EKed while on a berserk slate is a risk that a player takes when using a slate</em>.</li>
      <li>IEntertainment and Helbreath Staff will restore slates that 
are lost due to a random disconnection however, will not restore them 
for intentional disconnections or termination of connection to avoid 
being EKed or to extend the use.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The selling or trading of in game items for real currency or other game items is strictly prohibited, punishable by ban.</li>
</ol>
<p>If an infraction of any rule occurs the account is still liable for any punishment due. "<em>It was my brother</em>.."
 or friend or the family parrot does not matter. IENT doesn't support 
the sharing of accounts. By giving some one your account information, 
you are allowing them to do with your account as they wish. We will not 
restore, refund or place the punishments of their actions on their 
accounts. The account it happens on is the account that is punished. 
Each warning sent to you is also noted down on your account and can be 
valid for at least 3 months after the warning was issued. Multiple 
warnings within a short time span will result in more severe punishment.
 The goal of the rules is to enforce a fun and enjoyable play time for 
all.</p>
