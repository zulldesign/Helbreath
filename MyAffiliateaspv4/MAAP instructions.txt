Thank you for purchasing My ASP Affiliate Program V4
M.A.A.P. Is the easiest, fastest and cheapest way to deploy an affiliate tracking system into your online shop.
It works perfect with small Paypal enabled instant purchase stores.
I designed it for my own store but it works with any store whereby the customer is sent to a final "Thank you page"
The commission structure is limited to a fixed fee per sale.(except for PayPal stores)



Requirements:

1. Windows Webserver (NT, W2K, IIS etc.)
2. Server side includes enabled server (SSI)
3. Basic HTML knowledge
4. 1 ODBC connection to Ms Access ( For DSN-less connection, please rename and use dsnless-affiliate.asp. also edit and change DBQ= to be the correct server path )


Installation:

1. Add all files to your webserver, including the folder "Connections".

2. Set up an ODBC to affiliate.mdb called "affiliate". (make sure the database is in a writable folder)

3. In your main/entry/home page insert the following ssi code right at the top of the page, before <html>.
<!--#include file="setcookies.asp" -->

4. In your "Thank you page" insert the following ssi code right at the top of the page, before <html>.
<!--#include file="setcommission.asp" -->

5. Rename your main/entry and Thankyou page to end with ".asp" (.html file cannot execute ssi codes)

6. Run admin.asp in your browser, Login as 123456, Click on settings and configure it as you wish.

That's it!!!



For PayPal IPN Use Only:

Basically same as above but do NOT do step 4. Instead, enable IPN in your paypal account and point it to the ipn.asp file.
Then edit all your PayPal buttons on your site and Add this line:

<input type="hidden" name="custom" value="<%= Request.Cookies("Affidcookie") %>">

Then do Step 5/6.

That's it! It will work with both fixed and percent commission.





Send affiliates through a link on your site to "affiliates.asp", here they can sign up or login to check their stats.

Your administration page is "admin.asp" which i suggest you to rename to something less obvious.

- Password to /admin.asp is "123456". You can change this in the admin page.




How it works.:

Affiliates receive a url with ?Affid=xxx added to the end, where xxx is their unique code. When a visitor comes through to your site on that link, a cookie is set on his/her machine with the value of that code. After shoping, when the visitors reaches the "Thank you page" the cookie is converted into a session variable on the server, the affiliates database is then filtered and the appropriate affiliate gets his commmission.


-You may also want to edit affiliates.asp to change fonts, colours, background, and to customize the layout to blend in with your site.


It really is very simple. But if you need help, either email me at johnny@kattouf.com
